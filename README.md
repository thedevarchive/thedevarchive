# About Me
- 👋 This is The Dev Archive (@thedevarchive)
- 📁 This is just a place where I keep all the projects I've done over the years
-  My hobbies are board games, sketching, and building solo projects! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, ASP.NET, Blazor and React.js
- 👀 Aside from software dev, I'm interested in cybersecurity, cloud computing, AI and working with IoT
